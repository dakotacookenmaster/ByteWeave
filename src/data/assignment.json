                "description": "In this digital logic assignment, students will delve into the world of XOR gates aiming to create one using only two input gates, one output gate, and a combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates. XOR gates are fundamental in digital circuits, with a unique behavior: they produce a 'true' (1) output when there's an odd number of 'true' inputs, making them essential for various applications like data encryption and error checking. \n\n Your task is to design and construct a working XOR gate circuit, demonstrating your understanding of how logic gates interact to achieve this specific function. For example, if the inputs A and B are 1 and 0, respectively, the XOR gate should produce an output of 1. Likewise, if A is 0 and B is 1, the output should still be 1. However, if both inputs A and B are either 0 or 1, the output should be 0. Through this assignment, you'll not only learn about XOR gates but also hone your digital circuit design skills, with practical hands-on experience in creating, testing, and troubleshooting logic circuits.",
