                "description": "In this digital logic assignment, students will delve into the world of XOR gates aiming to create one using only two input gates, one output gate, and a combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates. XOR gates are fundamental in digital circuits, with a unique behavior: they produce a 'true' (1) output when there's an odd number of 'true' inputs, making them essential for various applications like data encryption and error checking. \n\n Your task is to design and construct a working XOR gate circuit, demonstrating your understanding of how logic gates interact to achieve this specific function. For example, if the inputs A and B are 1 and 0, respectively, the XOR gate should produce an output of 1. Likewise, if A is 0 and B is 1, the output should still be 1. However, if both inputs A and B are either 0 or 1, the output should be 0. Through this assignment, you'll not only learn about XOR gates but also hone your digital circuit design skills, with practical hands-on experience in creating, testing, and troubleshooting logic circuits.",

Even parity circuits are crucial in digital systems, designed to produce a 'false' (0) output when there's an even number of 'true' inputs, providing robust error-checking capabilities. \n\n Your task is to design and construct a functional even parity circuit, showcasing your comprehension of how logic gates collaborate to achieve this specific function. For instance, if the inputs A, B, and C are 1, 0, and 1, respectively, the even parity circuit should yield an output of 0 since there are two 'true' inputs. Conversely, if A, B, and C are all 1, the output should be 1, as there's an odd number of 'true' inputs. Through this assignment, you'll not only learn about even parity circuits but also refine your digital circuit design skills, gaining hands-on experience in creating, testing, and troubleshooting logical circuits.",
